# LinkedIn Learning Python course by Joe Marini
# Example file for working with Exceptions
#

# Errors can happen in programs, and we need a clean way to handle them
# This code will cause an error because you can't divide by zero:
# x = 10 / 0

# Exceptions provide a way of catching errors and then handling them in 
# a separate section of the code to group them together
# try:
#   x = 10/0
#   print(x)
# except:
#   print("error")

# You can also catch specific exceptions
try:
  x = int(input("enter a num:"))
  print("output:", 10/x)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
  print("error:", e)
except ValueError as e:
  print("error:", e)
finally:
  print("finally block")
